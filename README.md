Export (module for Omeka S)
===============================

Export is a module for Omeka S which exports item sets into CSV files. Each row in the file represents metadata for a single item.

Export CSV files include item metadata and a link to associated media. 

This module has not been tested with very large item sets. Consider breaking very large item sets in to smaller item sets for exporting.
